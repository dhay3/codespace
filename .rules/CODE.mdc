- Code style strictly adheres to the [Google Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide).
- Code should be concise and easily readable, primarily for humans to read.
- If the same logic appears three times, consider abstracting it into a reusable component and decide based on the assessed benefits of abstraction.
- Variables and functions must be accompanied by detailed comments. eg
```
def func(var1, var2):
 """
 @description describe this function...
 @parameter var1 describe this variable...
 @parameter var2 describe this variable...
 @return var4 describe this variable...
 """
 # describe this variable
 var3 = var1 + var2
 var4 = int(var3)
 return var4
```
- Privacy content, eg, password, token, etc., should be encrypted or hashed; API keys should be stored in `.env` file and not committed to git; authentication or authorization should be integrated with a human-machine verification if it is a web application.
