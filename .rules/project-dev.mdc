# Project Development Workflows

This document defines the autonomous workflow for developing and revising a project. Execute stages sequentially, reporting progress at each step.


## Package Management

- Use `conda` as the environment manager.
- Use `uv` as the python package manager.
- Use `npm` as the node package manager.

## CI/CD

- Use github actions as the CI/CD tool.

## 🚨 Quality Checks

**MANDATORY**: After completing code changes, run `mcp__vscode-mcp__get_diagnostics` on the modified files to identify any errors introduced by your changes and fix them.
